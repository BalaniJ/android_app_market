# App Growth Prediction

App Growth Prediction Project

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there arenâ€™t many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. Thus, this insight analysis helps provide more information about the Android App market than is usually available due to the aforementioned lack of datasets for Google Play apps.

Our goal is to look through this dataset, provide market analytic insights and predict the growth of an app in terms of the number of expected app installations. In doing so, we help the stakeholders achieve a better strategy of how to go about deciding app specifics such as the size and price (if it can be helped ofcourse for the former at least).

The notebook with the .ipynb label contains specified cells for data overview, cleaning, exploratory insight analysis, modelling, and evaluations respectively. The relevant graphs can also be found in the outputs of the respective code cells as well.
